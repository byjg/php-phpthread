# Promise Benchmark

The `ByJG PHPThread Promise` implements Promises in PHP, adhering to the JavaScript Promise model.
This means the Promise is truly asynchronous and non-blocking.

Letâ€™s illustrate how the Promise works asynchronously and non-blocking, highlighting the key differences compared to
other PHP implementations.

In the examples below, we will create 10 Promises, each resolving in a specified time. To simulate intensive processing,
we use the sleep function.

## Example Setup

For this test, the first Promise will take 10 seconds to resolve, the second 9 seconds, the third 8 seconds, and so on,
with the last Promise resolving in just 1 second. This setup ensures that the total resolution time varies based on
implementation behavior.

### Expected Behavior

1. Blocking Implementation:

   If the implementation is blocking, the total execution time will be approximately the sum of all the Promises (10 +
   9 + 8 + ... + 1 = 55 seconds). In this case, the Promises will resolve in the order they were created.

2. Non-Blocking Implementation:

   If the implementation is non-blocking, the total execution time will be equivalent to the duration of the longest
   Promise (10 seconds). Promises will resolve in the order of completion rather than the order of creation.

The `ByJG PHPThread Promise` demonstrates non-blocking behavior, completing all tasks in just 10 seconds while resolving
Promises as they finish.

### Comparison Table

| Implementation         | Time to run    | Resolve Order              |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| ByJG PHPThread Promise | 10.044 seconds | In the order of completion |
| ReactPHP Promise       | 55.038 seconds | In the order of creation   |
| Guzzle Promise         | 55.035 seconds | In the order of creation   |

## Test Code

### ByJG Thread Promise

Install the package:

```bash
composer require byjg/phpthread
```

Then created a file called `benchmark.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php

use ByJG\PHPThread\Promise;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$promiseArray = [];

foreach (range(1, 10) as $i) {
    // Here the promisse is created and start executing in background.
    $promiseArray[$i] = Promise::create(function ($resolve, $reject) use ($i) {
            sleep(11 - $i);
            $resolve("Promise $i is fulfilled!");
        })
        ->then(
            function ($value) {
                echo "Success: $value\n";
            }
        );
    echo "Promise $i {$promiseArray[$i]->getPromiseId()} is created!\n";
}

Promise::all(...$promiseArray)->await();

Promise::gc();
```

When you run the script you will see the following output:

```bash
$ time php benchmark.php

### ReactPHP Promise

Install the package:

```bash
composer require react/promise
composer require react/event-loop
```

Then created a file called `benchmark-reactphp.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$loop = React\EventLoop\Loop::get();
$promiseArray = [];

foreach (range(1, 10) as $i) {
    $promiseArray[$i] = new React\Promise\Promise(function ($resolve, $reject) use ($i, $loop) {
//        $loop->addTimer(11 - $i, function () use ($resolve, $i) {
        sleep(11 - $i);
        $resolve("Promise $i is fulfilled!");
    });

    $promiseArray[$i]->then(
        function ($value) {
            echo "Success: $value\n";
        },
    );
}

$loop->run();
```

When you run the script you will see the following output:

```bash
$ time php benchmark.php

Success: Promise 1 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 2 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 3 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 4 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 5 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 6 is fulfilled!

Success: Promise 9 is fulfilled!
Success: Promise 10 is fulfilled!

### Guzzle Promise

Install the package:

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/promises
```

Then created a file called `benchmark-guzzle.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php
use GuzzleHttp\Promise\Promise;
use GuzzleHttp\Promise\Utils;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$promiseArray = [];

foreach (range(1, 10) as $i) {
    $promiseArray[$i] = new Promise(function () use ($i, &$promiseArray) {
        sleep(11 - $i);
        $promiseArray[$i]->resolve("Promise $i is fulfilled!");
    });

    $promiseArray[$i]
        ->then(
            function ($value) {
                echo "Success: $value\n";
            }
        );
    echo "Promise $i is created!\n";
}

Utils::all($promiseArray)->wait();
