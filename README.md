ByJG PHPThread simplifies working with threads and non-blocking code in PHP,
bridging the gap for a language that was not inherently designed for threading.

## Overview

PHPThread is a polyfill library that abstracts threading functionality for PHP, providing a consistent
interface regardless of the underlying PHP setup (ZTS or Fork). It empowers developers to implement
thread-like behavior and asynchronous processing in PHP applications.

---

## Why Threads in PHP?

PHP is traditionally designed for a **request-response cycle**, where scripts are executed
only in response to client requests and terminate after sending a response. While efficient for
web applications, this architecture lacks native threading support for background or concurrent tasks.

With PHPThread, you can overcome these limitations by leveraging:

- **Forking (Default PHP)** for simulating threading.
- **Zend Thread Safety (ZTS)** for true multi-threading environments.

---

## How It Works

### Default PHP (Non-ZTS)

In standard PHP installations (without ZTS), threading is simulated using the `fork` command.
This approach creates a new process by cloning the parent process. While not a true thread,
this method can approximate threading behavior.

**Requirements:**

- [pcntl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pcntl.php): For process control.
- [shmop](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php): For shared memory.

---

### PHP ZTS (Zend Thread Safety)

With ZTS-enabled PHP, true multi-threading becomes possible. This setup is ideal for production environments where
robust threading is required. The ZTS version is compiled with the `--enable-zts` flag, but it may not be included in
all PHP distributions.

**Requirements:**

- [parallel](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.parallel.php): For multi-threading functionality.
- [shmop](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php): For memory sharing.

---

## Features

- **Thread Management**: Simplified thread creation and execution ([docs](docs/thread.md)).
- **Thread Pools**: Efficiently manage and reuse threads for multiple tasks ([docs](docs/threadpool.md)).
- **Promises (Experimental)**: Asynchronous task management with a promise-like API ([docs](docs/promises.md)).

Supported Promise Methods:

- `then()`: Execute a callback on promise resolution.
- `catch()`: Execute a callback on promise rejection.
- `finally()`: Execute a callback after resolution or rejection.
- `Promise::resolve()`: Resolve a promise.
- `Promise::reject()`: Reject a promise.
- `Promise::all()`: Wait for all promises to resolve.
- `Promise::race()`: Wait for the first promise to resolve.
